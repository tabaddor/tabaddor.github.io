I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor studying Computer Science and Complex Systems. I am advised by PhD candidate [Mert D. Pes√©](https://mpese.com) in the [Real-Time Computing Lab](https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/). Currently, we are researching and developing a real-time, performant vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) anomaly detection system for connected vehicles. Additionally, I lead the software subteam of the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles. This upcoming summer (2021) I will be working as a Software Engineer Intern on the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) team at [HARMAN International](https://harman.com).

My research interests include leveraging **machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning** for improving **safety-critical systems**.

My coursework includes Graduate-Level Machine Learning (_EECS 545_), Advanced Algorithms (_EECS 477_), Artificial Intelligence (_EECS 492_), Computer Security (_EECS 388_), and Web Systems (_EECS 485_).
